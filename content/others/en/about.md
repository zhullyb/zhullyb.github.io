## About Me

Hi, I’m zhullyb, a senior-year undergraduate majoring in front-end development, currently studying in ZJUT (Zhejiang University of Technology). I run this blog to share technical insights, solve real-world problems, and build a library of resources that can help others facing the same challenges.

I am actively seeking opportunities in major tech companies through campus recruitment. My passion lies in building reliable, efficient, and elegant web applications, and I enjoy contributing to open-source projects. On my GitHub, I maintain several repositories, including my personal blog built with Nuxt.js, as well as tools and utilities that reflect my interests in front-end engineering, Linux packaging, and system-level work.

I’m also deeply involved in the Linux ecosystem: I maintain several AUR and archlinuxcn packages. In my free time, I tinker with Fedora (though I keep drifting back to Arch!), explore new technologies, and brainstorm open-source ideas.

## Why This Blog Exists

This blog is more than just a personal journal — it’s a space for technical documentation and sharing. My goal is to help readers who face similar development challenges by providing well-researched, original content. Whether you're debugging a tricky bug, optimizing performance, or building from scratch, I hope you find something here useful.

I’m committed to keeping this blog alive. I try to renew the domain regularly, and if ever server costs become a burden, I’m prepared to migrate it to a serverless setup to keep the content accessible.
