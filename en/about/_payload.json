I run this blog to share technical insights, solve real-world problems, and build a library of resources that can help others facing the same challenges.",[15,19,20],{},"I am actively seeking opportunities in major tech companies through campus recruitment. My passion lies in building reliable, efficient, and elegant web applications, and I enjoy contributing to open-source projects.
