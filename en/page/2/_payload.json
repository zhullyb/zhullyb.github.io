Compared to clipboard.js, copy-to-clipboard doesn't depend on HTML elements and can be called directly in JavaScript, which I personally prefer. In modern frontend frameworks like Vue/React, we generally don't directly manipulate the DOM, so clipboard.js isn't very suitable, but this copy-to-clipboard works well. Additionally, besides the execCommand solution, copy-to-clipboard specifically adapts the ",[67,3696,3458],{}," solution for older IE browsers, and calls a prompt window to let users copy manually as a final fallback when both fail.",[105,3699,3700],{},"Example as follows:",[134,3702,3704],{"className":1033,"code":3703,"language":1035,"meta":139,"style":139},"import copy from 'copy-to-clipboard';\n\ncopy('Text');\n",[67,3705,3706,3722,3726],{"__ignoreMap":139},[143,3707,3708,3711,3714,3717,3720],{"class":145,"line":146},[143,3709,3710],{"class":1042},"import",[143,3712,3713],{"class":156}," copy",[143,3715,3716],{"class":1042}," from",[143,3718,3719],{"class":172}," 'copy-to-clipboard'",[143,3721,1099],{"class":149},[143,3723,3724],{"class":145,"line":153},[143,3725,521],{"emptyLinePlaceholder":520},[143,3727,3728,3731,3733,3736],{"class":145,"line":163},[143,3729,3730],{"class":271},"copy",[143,3732,2820],{"class":149},[143,3734,3735],{"class":172},"'Text'",[143,3737,1200],{"class":149},[105,3739,3740],{},"Compared to clipboard.js, the usage approach is more intuitive, but unfortunately it was born at the wrong time and isn't as famous as clipboard.js (naming might also be a factor).",[100,3742,3744],{"id":3743},"vueuse-useclipboard",[46,3745,3748],{"href":3746,"rel":3747},"https://vueuse.org/core/useClipboard/",[50],"VueUse - useClipboard",[105,3750,3751,3752,3757,3758,3761,3762,3764],{},"VueUse's implementation of useClipboard is the one I'm most satisfied with. useClipboard fully considers browser compatibility, ",[214,3753,3754,3755],{},"prioritizing ",[67,3756,3117],{}," when conditions for using navigator.clipboard are met, then ",[214,3759,3760],{},"falling back to execCommand-implemented legacyCopy"," when navigator.clipboard isn't supported or ",[67,3763,3117],{}," fails.
