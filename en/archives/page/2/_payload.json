Compared to clipboard.js, copy-to-clipboard doesn't depend on HTML elements and can be called directly in JavaScript, which I personally prefer. In modern frontend frameworks like Vue/React, we generally don't directly manipulate the DOM, so clipboard.js isn't very suitable, but this copy-to-clipboard works well. Additionally, besides the execCommand solution, copy-to-clipboard specifically adapts the ",[66,3695,3457],{}," solution for older IE browsers, and calls a prompt window to let users copy manually as a final fallback when both fail.",[104,3698,3699],{},"Example as follows:",[133,3701,3703],{"className":1032,"code":3702,"language":1034,"meta":138,"style":138},"import copy from 'copy-to-clipboard';\n\ncopy('Text');\n",[66,3704,3705,3721,3725],{"__ignoreMap":138},[142,3706,3707,3710,3713,3716,3719],{"class":144,"line":145},[142,3708,3709],{"class":1041},"import",[142,3711,3712],{"class":155}," copy",[142,3714,3715],{"class":1041}," from",[142,3717,3718],{"class":171}," 'copy-to-clipboard'",[142,3720,1098],{"class":148},[142,3722,3723],{"class":144,"line":152},[142,3724,520],{"emptyLinePlaceholder":519},[142,3726,3727,3730,3732,3735],{"class":144,"line":162},[142,3728,3729],{"class":271},"copy",[142,3731,2819],{"class":148},[142,3733,3734],{"class":171},"'Text'",[142,3736,1199],{"class":148},[104,3738,3739],{},"Compared to clipboard.js, the usage approach is more intuitive, but unfortunately it was born at the wrong time and isn't as famous as clipboard.js (naming might also be a factor).",[99,3741,3743],{"id":3742},"vueuse-useclipboard",[45,3744,3747],{"href":3745,"rel":3746},"https://vueuse.org/core/useClipboard/",[49],"VueUse - useClipboard",[104,3749,3750,3751,3756,3757,3760,3761,3763],{},"VueUse's implementation of useClipboard is the one I'm most satisfied with. useClipboard fully considers browser compatibility, ",[214,3752,3753,3754],{},"prioritizing ",[66,3755,3116],{}," when conditions for using navigator.clipboard are met, then ",[214,3758,3759],{},"falling back to execCommand-implemented legacyCopy"," when navigator.clipboard isn't supported or ",[66,3762,3116],{}," fails.
