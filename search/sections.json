Friendly reminder: SSH tunnels were frequently used in the early 2010s to establish cross-border access, but quickly faded from the scene due to their distinctive traffic characteristics. Therefore, don't use SSH for large amounts of cross-border network transmission, as it's easy to get blocked. Of course, there are many ways to achieve this goal. Other tools like frp can achieve the same effect, but the SSH tunnel solution can be started and stopped on demand without additional configuration, which is why I primarily recommend it. html pre.shiki code .s5ixo, html code.shiki .s5ixo{--shiki-default:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF}html pre.shiki code .sLKXg, html code.shiki .sLKXg{--shiki-default:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD}html .default .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html.dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html pre.shiki code .sAdtL, html code.shiki .sAdtL{--shiki-default:#4078F2;--shiki-dark:#61AFEF}html pre.shiki code .sDhpE, html code.shiki .sDhpE{--shiki-default:#50A14F;--shiki-dark:#98C379}html pre.shiki code .sAGMh, html code.shiki .sAGMh{--shiki-default:#986801;--shiki-dark:#D19A66}","level":2},{"id":"/2025/12/10/caddy-traffic-proxy-on-layer-4","title":"Layer 4 Traffic Proxying with Caddy: A Practical Guide","titles":[],"content":"","level":1},{"id":"/2025/12/10/caddy-traffic-proxy-on-layer-4#background","title":"Background","titles":["Layer 4 Traffic Proxying with Caddy: A Practical Guide"],"content":"On one of my VPS servers with optimized routing, port 443 needs to serve two distinct purposes: Hosting my blog for visitors from mainland China, handling HTTPS encryption/decryption and serving static contentDisguising certain special-purpose traffic to mimic HTTPS traffic from well-known, commonly-allowed websites (yes, I'm talking about Reality) This meant I needed a solution to handle both roles simultaneously on the same port of the same server.","level":2},{"id":"/2025/12/10/caddy-traffic-proxy-on-layer-4#choosing-the-solution","title":"Choosing the Solution","titles":["Layer 4 Traffic Proxying with Caddy: A Practical Guide"],"content":"I've long been aware that Nginx's  directive can achieve Layer 4 (raw TCP stream forwarding) traffic splitting based on SNI recognition.

Unfortunately, Safari still lacks software decoding for AV1. Only Apple devices with M3 (or later) chips and iPhone 15 Pro (or later) support hardware AV1 decoding. Older Apple devices simply cannot play AV1 videos in Safari.\n(Let’s just say Safari has become the modern-day IE—a clear roadblock to Web advancement.) Beyond playback compatibility, AV1 encoding is demanding. Among consumer GPUs, only NVIDIA RTX 40-series, AMD RX 7000-series, and Intel Arc A380 (and newer) support hardware AV1 encoding. Apple’s M-series chips still offer no AV1 encoding hardware acceleration whatsoever.

It is governed by multiple patent pools (e.g., MPEG LA, HEVC Advance, Velos Media), resulting in fragmented and costly licensing terms. These high licensing fees have drastically limited its adoption—especially in open ecosystems and web contexts. Chromium and Firefox refuse to shoulder HEVC licensing costs, so they do not ship with built-in HEVC software decoders. Browsers today generally follow a “hardware decode if possible; otherwise, give up” policy. Firefox on Linux, however, tries a workaround: if hardware decode fails, it leverages system-installed FFmpeg for software decoding. Fortunately, HEVC—standardized in 2013—has now gained near-universal hardware decode support: Apple treats HEVC as a first-class citizen, supporting it across its entire product lineup.

Its compression efficiency rivals HEVC—yet its biggest advantage is being completely royalty-free. VP9 was Google’s defiant response to HEVC’s licensing hurdles: “You keep feasting on royalties; I’ll host a free buffet.” Thanks to its zero-cost licensing and aggressive promotion across Google’s ecosystem (YouTube, WebRTC, Chrome), VP9 quickly became the de facto standard for web video—especially before AV1’s rise. In fact, it even pressured Apple—longtime gatekeeper of proprietary codecs—to add VP9 support to Safari in macOS 11 (Big Sur) and iOS 14 (though WebM container support arrived slightly later). VP9 enjoys near-universal software decode support: Chromium, Firefox, Edge, and even Safari include native support. Hardware decode support is also widespread: Intel Skylake (6th Gen Core) and later, NVIDIA GTX 950+, and AMD Vega/RDNA GPUs all support full VP9 decode. Unless you're running museum-grade hardware, VP9 playback “just works.” Encoding remains VP9’s weak point—Google’s reference encoder, , lags behind / in speed.

Since its standardization in 2003, it has dominated everything: web streaming, Blu-ray, live broadcasts, surveillance, and smartphone recording. Its unbeatable strength? Universal compatibility. Almost any screen-equipped device can decode H.264. Software decode has been standard in browsers and players for well over a decade; hardware decode dates back to Intel Sandy Bridge, NVIDIA Fermi, AMD VLIW4—and even Raspberry Pis or smart refrigerators can handle it. While H.264 does involve patents, its licensing is comparatively pragmatic: MPEG LA’s pool is affordable, and free online video streaming incurs no fees. Thus, Chromium, Firefox, Safari, and Edge all ship with H.264 software decode built in. That said, as a 20‑year‑old codec, H.264 lags far behind VP9, HEVC, and AV1 in compression efficiency. At equivalent quality, H.264 typically needs 30–50% higher bitrates than AV1—making it suboptimal for bandwidth- or storage-constrained scenarios. Yet in today’s pragmatic world—where playability beats perfection—H.264 remains the default fallback, the “reliable old workhorse”. So even as AV1, HEVC, and VP9 gain ground, H.264 retains its central role in the video ecosystem—so long as some browsers lack AV1 support (looking at you, Safari), servers want to avoid costly transcoding, or users still run legacy devices.","level":3},{"id":"/2025/06/02/choosing-the-right-video-compression-format-for-web-in-2025#summary","title":"Summary","titles":["In 2025, How to Choose the Right Video Compression Algorithm for Web Pages?","What Are the Mainstream Compression Algorithms Today?"],"content":"Browsers can no longer singlehandedly abstract away hardware and OS discrepancies.

In the previous post, I discussed switching to authoritative DNS servers that are physically closer to visitors to improve speed, but TLD (Top-Level Domain) Nameservers are beyond our control — specifically, the portion highlighted in red in the diagram below.

If I run a DNS recursive server on my local network, this result represents the minimum time required for the red portion in the sequence diagram above (the DNS server needs additional time to process the request). Using multi-location ping latency tests provided by some websites, we can infer in which countries or regions this TLD has deployed Anycast nodes. Below is the result provided by iplark.com. We can infer that the .in TLD Nameserver has deployed Anycast nodes in at least Japan, Hong Kong, USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, Brazil, India, South Africa, and other locations, while latency within mainland China is relatively high. As a comparison, we can use the same method to examine the Anycast nodes for the .cn domain's TLD Nameserver.

In reality, many external factors affect DNS cold start resolution time: Peering exists between public DNS servers and TLD Nameservers, making their communication very fastThe TLD Nameserver has poor performance, requiring an additional tens of milliseconds to process your requestAmong the TLD's several Nameservers, some are faster than others, and the public DNS server you use can select the faster one based on historical data... Therefore, we need a testing approach based on actual DNS resolution requests. Testing DNS cold start has always faced a dilemma — we don't manage public DNS servers and cannot log in to manually clear their cache, so only the first test result may be valid, with subsequent requests hitting the cache. However, this time we're testing the latency between the public DNS server and the TLD Nameserver. With Gemini's reminder, I realized we could test the resolution time for random, non-existent domains across different regions using public DNS, which can reflect differences between various TLDs. So, the test code is below. You can use bash on common Linux systems to execute this code. Ensure you have the dig and shasum commands installed, and I recommend using tools like screen/tmux to run it in the background, as the entire testing process may last over ten minutes.

Generic domain suffixes like .com, .net, and .org perform well in most regions globally, but their resolution speed within mainland China is relatively slow because they haven't deployed Anycast nodes on the mainland.

However, this idea is often futile under the Anycast architecture of the modern internet. The core concept of Anycast is: the same IP address exists at multiple global nodes simultaneously, and user requests are routed to the \"closest\" or \"most optimal network path\" node. This means that public DNS servers like Google DNS (8.8.8.8), Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1), AliDNS (223.5.5.5), and Tencent DNS (119.29.29.29) are not backed by a single, centralized server, but a cluster of nodes distributed worldwide, routed dynamically. Thus, the problem arises: The pre-warming script I run in Shanghai might hit the Shanghai node of 223.5.5.5;But a visitor from Beijing will be routed to the Beijing node of 223.5.5.5;The caches of these two nodes are independent and not shared with each other.

From a macro perspective, this traps \"low-traffic sites\" in a kind of fatalistic loop: Due to low traffic, cache hits are rare;Due to cache misses, resolution time is high;Due to high resolution time, first-paint performance is poor, and users visit less;Due to fewer user visits, the cache is even harder to hit.

Out of desperation, I fed the code to ChatGPT-4o—and got a lifeline: The phenomenon you describe — “a jarring upward jump on the 9th scroll, which disappears when DevTools is open” — is almost certainly due to frame skipping (frame rate fluctuations) or timer precision issues in the browser’s rendering pipeline.Such bugs commonly arise when combining -driven animation with improperly timed style switches (e.g.,  toggles), causing transition frame skips.

OCSP, as a method for real-time certificate validity queries, had a beautiful initial vision: when a browser accesses a website, it can send a brief request to the CA's (Certificate Authority's) OCSP server, asking whether the certificate is still valid. This seemed much more efficient than downloading a massive CRL (Certificate Revocation List). However, OCSP has exposed numerous flaws in practical application: First is the performance issue. Although individual requests are small, when millions of users simultaneously access websites, OCSP servers must handle massive amounts of real-time queries. This not only creates enormous server pressure for CAs but also increases latency for users accessing websites. If OCSP servers respond slowly or even crash, browsers may interrupt connections due to inability to confirm certificate status, or have to \"turn a blind eye\" for the sake of user experience, both of which undermine OCSP's security. More seriously is the privacy issue. Each OCSP query essentially reports the user's browsing behavior to the CA. This means the CA can know when a user accessed which website. While OCSP queries themselves don't contain personally identifiable information, by combining this information with data like IP addresses, CAs can completely build profiles of users' browsing habits. For privacy-conscious users and developers, this \"silent surveillance\" is unacceptable. Even if CAs intentionally don't retain this information, regional laws may force CAs to collect it. Furthermore, OCSP has security flaws in its design. Due to concerns about connection timeouts affecting user experience, browsers typically default to a soft-fail mechanism: if they cannot connect to the OCSP server, they choose to allow rather than block the connection. Attackers can exploit this by blocking communication between the client and OCSP server, causing queries to always timeout, thus easily bypassing certificate status verification.","level":2},{"id":"/2025/10/16/how-s-mozilla-crlite-going-now#ocsp-stapling","title":"OCSP Stapling","titles":["Post-OCSP Era: How Browsers Address New Certificate Revocation Challenges","OCSP's Dilemma: The Trade-off Between Performance and Privacy"],"content":"Based on these flaws, we have the OCSP stapling solution, which I covered in last year's blog post, feel free to review.","level":3},{"id":"/2025/10/16/how-s-mozilla-crlite-going-now#ocsp-must-staple","title":"OCSP Must-Staple","titles":["Post-OCSP Era: How Browsers Address New Certificate Revocation Challenges","OCSP's Dilemma: The Trade-off Between Performance and Privacy"],"content":"OCSP Must-Staple is an extension option when applying for SSL certificates.

In 2012, Chrome disabled CRLs and OCSP checks by default, turning to its own self-designed certificate verification mechanism. It's well known that revocation lists can be extremely large. If browsers needed to download and parse a complete global revocation list, it would be a performance disaster (Mozilla's team mentioned in this year's blog that file sizes from downloading 3000 active CRLs would reach 300MB). Through analyzing historical data, the Chromium team discovered that most revoked certificates belong to a few high-risk categories, such as the certificate authority (CA) itself being compromised, or certificates from certain large websites being revoked. Based on this insight, CRLSets adopts the following strategy: Tiered Revocation: Chromium doesn't download all revoked certificate information, but rather the Google team maintains a streamlined list containing the \"most important\" revocation information. This list is regularly updated and pushed to users through Chrome browser updates.Streamlined Efficiency: This list is very small in size, currently about 600KB. It contains certificates that would cause large-scale security incidents if abused, such as CA intermediate certificates, or certificates from some well-known websites (like Google, Facebook).Sacrificing Partial Security: The disadvantage of this approach is also obvious—it cannot cover all certificate revocation situations. For an ordinary website's revoked certificate, CRLSets likely cannot detect it. According to Mozilla's blog this year, CRLSets only contains 1%-2% of unexpired revoked certificate information. While CRLSets is an \"imperfect\" solution, it has found a balance between performance and usability. It ensures basic security for users accessing mainstream websites while avoiding the performance and privacy overhead brought by OCSP. For Chromium, rather than pursuing an OCSP solution that's difficult to implement perfectly in reality, it's better to concentrate efforts on solving the most urgent security threats.","level":2},{"id":"/2025/10/16/how-s-mozilla-crlite-going-now#firefoxs-solution-from-crls-to-crlite","title":"Firefox's Solution: From CRLs to CRLite","titles":["Post-OCSP Era: How Browsers Address New Certificate Revocation Challenges"],"content":"Unlike Chromium's \"taking only a ladle\" strategy, Firefox developers have been searching for a solution that can guarantee comprehensiveness while solving performance issues. To solve this problem, Mozilla proposed an innovative solution: CRLite. CRLite's design philosophy is to use data structures like hash functions and Bloom filters to compress massive certificate revocation lists into a compact, downloadable, and easily locally verifiable format. CRLite's working principle can be simply summarized as: Data Compression: CAs periodically generate lists of all their revoked certificates.Server Processing: Mozilla's servers collect these lists and use techniques like cryptographic hash functions and Bloom filters to encode all revoked certificate information into a very compact data structure.Client Verification: The browser downloads this compressed file, and when accessing a website, it only needs to perform hash calculations on the certificate locally, then query this local file to quickly determine whether the certificate has been revoked. Compared to CRLSets, CRLite's advantage is that it can achieve comprehensive coverage of all revoked certificates while maintaining an extremely small size. More importantly, it completes verification entirely locally, which means the browser doesn't need to send requests to any third-party servers, thus completely solving OCSP's privacy problem. Firefox's current strategy performs incremental updates to CRLite data every 12 hours, with daily downloads of approximately 300KB; it performs a full snapshot sync every 45 days, with downloads of approximately 4MB. Mozilla has opened their data dashboard, where you can find recent CRLite data sizes: https://yardstick.mozilla.org/dashboard/snapshot/c1WZrxGkNxdm9oZp7xVvGUEFJCELfApN Starting with Firefox Desktop version 137 released on April 1, 2025, Firefox began gradually replacing OCSP validation with CRLite; on August 19 of the same year, Firefox Desktop 142 officially deprecated OCSP verification for DV certificates.

What these solutions have in common is: transforming certificate revocation verification from real-time online queries (OCSP) to localized verification, thereby avoiding OCSP's inherent performance bottlenecks and privacy risks. In the future, the certificate revocation ecosystem will no longer rely on a single, centralized OCSP server. Instead, a more diverse, distributed, and intelligent new era is arriving. OCSP as a technology may gradually be phased out, but the core security problem of \"certificate revocation\" that it attempted to solve will forever remain a focus of browsers and the network security community.","level":2},{"id":"/2025/10/16/how-s-mozilla-crlite-going-now#see-also","title":"See Also","titles":["Post-OCSP Era: How Browsers Address New Certificate Revocation Challenges"],"content":"CRLite: Fast, private, and comprehensive certificate revocation checking in Firefox - Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blogThe Slow Death of OCSP | Feisty Duckmozilla/crlite: Compact certificate revocation lists for the WebPKIOCSP Service Has Reached End of Life - Let's EncryptEnding OCSP Support in 2025 - Let's EncryptIntent to End OCSP Service - Let's EncryptCRLSets - The Chromium ProjectsGoogle Chrome Will No Longer Check for Revoked SSL Certificates Online | PCWorldChrome does certificate revocation better | ZDNET主流客户端/浏览器证书吊销验证机制技术对与分析 | 帽之岛, Hat's LandOCSP 的淡出… – Gea-Suan Lin's BLOG","level":2},{"id":"/2025/04/21/how-we-copy-text-to-clipboard-with-js-in-2025","title":"How to Copy Text to Clipboard with JavaScript in 2025","titles":[],"content":"","level":1},{"id":"/2025/04/21/how-we-copy-text-to-clipboard-with-js-in-2025#fundamental-principles","title":"Fundamental Principles","titles":["How to Copy Text to Clipboard with JavaScript in 2025"],"content":"If you try searching for this article's title on a search engine, the articles you find will likely suggest using the following two APIs.

With IE 10's release on September 4th of that year, the execCommand family welcomed two new members—the copy/cut commands (this claim comes from Chrome's blog, while MDN believes IE 9 already supported it). Three years later, when Google Chrome version 42 (released April 14, 2015) added support for execCommand's copy/cut, more and more browser vendors began implementing this standard. Finally, with Safari 10 on iOS released on September 13, 2016, web developers at last obtained the first non-Flash JavaScript solution for copying to clipboard in history. When document.execCommand's first parameter is \"copy\", it can copy user-selected text to the clipboard. Based on this API implementation, someone quickly developed what became the most common JavaScript implementation on the web today—first create an invisible DOM element, use JavaScript to simulate user text selection, and call execCommand('copy') to copy the text to the user's clipboard. The rough code implementation is as follows: Although this API has long been deprecated by W3C and is marked as Deprecated on MDN, it remains the most common solution in the market. While writing this article, I examined MDN's English original page on archive.org and its change history on Github. This API was first marked as Obsolete in January-February 2020, then first marked as Deprecated in January 2021, with a red background color warning developers that the API may stop working at any time. However, as of this article's publication, all commonly used browsers still maintain compatibility with this API, at least for the copy command. This API has been widely used on so many sites that removing support for it would cause massive site failures. I believe all browser engines likely have no motivation in the short term to remove this API at the cost of losing compatibility. This means that this (seemingly bizarre) workaround of creating an invisible DOM to replace user text selection and executing execCommand to copy to the user's clipboard has left a significant mark in the history of frontend development.","level":3},{"id":"/2025/04/21/how-we-copy-text-to-clipboard-with-js-in-2025#clipboardwritetext","title":"Clipboard.writeText()","titles":["How to Copy Text to Clipboard with JavaScript in 2025","Fundamental Principles"],"content":"As native JavaScript was gradually enhanced, developers finally completed the Clipboard piece of the puzzle. On April 17, 2018, Chrome 66 took the first step; on October 23 of the same year, Firefox followed with the Clipboard API implementation. Finally, on March 24, 2020, with Apple's Safari 13.4 belatedly joining, frontend developers could finally breathe a sigh of relief, once again obtaining a copying solution that works across mainstream browsers. So if execCommand already achieved pure JavaScript text copying to clipboard, why do we still need the Clipboard API? Or rather, what advantages does this deliberately implemented Clipboard API actually have? The traditional execCommand solution typically requires creating a temporary invisible DOM, placing text, selecting text with JS, and executing the copy command. Setting aside how inelegant this hacky approach is when writing code, the operation of using JS to select text modifies the user's current text selection state, sometimes leading to decreased user experience.The Clipboard API is asynchronous, meaning it won't block the main thread when copying large amounts of text.The Clipboard API provides more capabilities, such as  and  allowing reading and writing more complex data to the clipboard, like rich text or images.The Clipboard API has more modern, explicit permission controls—write operations need to be called by active user actions, while read operations require users to explicitly grant permission in the browser UI. These permission controls give users greater control, so when execCommand exits the historical stage, web security will be further improved. However, at the current stage,  may not solve all problems. Setting aside old browser compatibility issues,  is only available on pages accessed via HTTPS (or localhost). If your project is deployed on a LAN and you try to access it directly via 192.18.1.x IP + port, then  will be in an  state.

How could I not mention this? Currently, the oldest tag that can be found in the ZeroClipboard Github repository is v1.0.7, released on June 9, 2012. I bet this project wasn't the first to implement copying text to clipboard through Flash. Someone must have implemented this functionality using Flash before, just not open-sourced as a separate library. ZeroClipboard worked by creating a transparent Flash Movie overlaying the trigger button. When users clicked the button, they actually clicked on the Flash Movie. JavaScript then communicated with the Flash Movie through , passing the text to be copied to Flash, which then wrote the text to the user's clipboard via Flash's API. In that era's context, this was the only solution that could implement cross-browser text copying to clipboard (although not every computer had Flash installed, and iOS didn't support Flash). The 6.6k star Github repository witnessed that chaotic era when each browser held onto its own private APIs, ultimately falling along with Flash as the execCommand solution rose.","level":3},{"id":"/2025/04/21/how-we-copy-text-to-clipboard-with-js-in-2025#other-imperfect-solutions","title":"Other Imperfect Solutions","titles":["How to Copy Text to Clipboard with JavaScript in 2025","Fundamental Principles"],"content":"","level":3},{"id":"/2025/04/21/how-we-copy-text-to-clipboard-with-js-in-2025#windowclipboarddatasetdata","title":"window.clipboardData.setData","titles":["How to Copy Text to Clipboard with JavaScript in 2025","Fundamental Principles","Other Imperfect Solutions"],"content":"This API was mainly used around 2000-2010 and only worked in IE browsers.

The earliest tag version was released on October 28, 2015, one month after Firefox supported execCommand and all three major PC browsers achieved full compatibility. clipboard.js only uses execCommand to implement clipboard copying. The project owner expects developers to use  to determine whether the user's browser supports the execCommand solution, and arrange success/failure actions based on the command execution's return value. However, what I find strange is that clipboard.js requires developers to pass a DOM selector (or HTML element/element list) when instantiating. It must have an actual HTML element to set event listeners to trigger the copy operation, rather than providing a JavaScript function for developers to call—although this isn't a limitation from execCommand. Example as follows: Yes, just one line of JavaScript can add listeners to all DOMs with the btn class. Perhaps this is why this repository got 34.1k stars. In 2015, when most people were still writing frontends with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, clipboard.js could reduce code volume without requiring developers to set up listeners themselves. clipboard.js also provides many advanced options to meet different developers' needs, such as allowing you to pass a function to get the text you need users to copy, or use Event listeners to provide feedback on whether copying succeeded.

When the browser requests index.html, the server can simultaneously push CSS/JS resources to the client. This way, after establishing the TCP/TLS connection, it only needs one RTT to retrieve all resources needed for page rendering. To minimize subsequent requests in HTTP/1.1, front-end developers have tried numerous optimization techniques. As Sukka mentioned in \"Static Resource Delivery Optimization: HTTP/2 and Server Push\": The concepts of critical resources, critical rendering path, and critical request chain have existed for a long time. Asynchronous resource loading is old news: lazy-loading images, videos, iframes, and even lazy-loading CSS, JS, DOM, and lazy execution of functions. However, the approach to critical resource delivery hasn't changed much. HTTP/2 Server Push created a new resource delivery paradigm.

On October 29, 2024, Mozilla released Firefox 132, removing support for HTTP/2 server push due to \"compatibility issues with multiple websites.\" With this, mainstream browser support for HTTP/2 Server Push has completely ended. From initially being viewed as an innovative feature to \"reduce round-trip latency and optimize first-screen loading,\" to its eventual complete deprecation, HTTP/2 push's lifecycle lasted only a few short years, becoming an important experiment in web performance optimization history.","level":2},{"id":"/2025/11/05/http-2-server-push-is-practically-obsolete#alternative-solutions","title":"Alternative Solutions","titles":["HTTP/2 Server Push Has Effectively \"Died\" - I Miss It"],"content":"","level":2},{"id":"/2025/11/05/http-2-server-push-is-practically-obsolete#_1-http-103-early-hints","title":"1. HTTP 103 Early Hints","titles":["HTTP/2 Server Push Has Effectively \"Died\" - I Miss It","Alternative Solutions"],"content":"103 Early Hints is the most direct \"successor\" to server push. It's an informational HTTP status code that allows the server to send an \"early hint\" response with Link headers before generating the complete HTML response (e.g., status code 200 OK). This Link header can tell the browser: \"Hey, I'm still preparing the main course (HTML), but you can start preparing the side dishes (CSS, JS) first.\" This way, the browser can utilize the server's \"thinking time\" to preemptively download critical resources or warm up connections to required origins, significantly reducing first-screen rendering time. Compared to server push: Decision authority lies with the client: Early Hints are just \"hints.\" The browser can decide whether to adopt them based on its own cache status, network conditions, and other factors. This solves server push's biggest pain point—servers cannot know about client caches, leading to redundant resource pushes.Better compatibility: It's a lighter mechanism that's easier for intermediary proxy servers to understand and relay. 103 Early Hints is very meaningful for dynamic blogs. Before backend computation, the 103 response can inform the browser about needed resources, allowing the browser to retrieve other resources first while waiting for the backend to return the final HTML. However, for static blogs like mine where everything is pre-built, it has absolutely no meaning. The gateway has enough time to send the 103 response that it could just directly send the HTML instead.","level":3},{"id":"/2025/11/05/http-2-server-push-is-practically-obsolete#_2-resource-hints-preload-prefetch","title":"2.

For example, font files hidden deep in CSS or first-screen images dynamically loaded by JS. Through preload, you can ensure these critical resources are discovered and downloaded early, avoiding render blocking.: Tells the browser about pages or resources the user might access in the future, requesting low-priority background downloads during browser idle time. For example, prefetching article page resources that users are most likely to click on the article list page, achieving near-\"instant\" navigation experience. Preload and Prefetch completely hand over resource loading control to developers and browsers. Through declarative methods, they allow fine-grained management of resource loading priority and timing.

HTTP/2 Server Push has effectively \"died.\" I miss it. In an ideal model, when the browser requests HTML, the server conveniently pushes the CSS and JS needed for rendering along with it, cleanly compressing what would originally be at least two round trips (RTT) into one. This is such a direct, such an elegant solution—almost the \"silver bullet\" that front-end engineers dream of when facing first-screen rendering latency issues. Behind it lies an ambitious spirit: attempting to thoroughly solve the \"critical request chain\" latency problem from the server side, once and for all. But the Web world is ultimately not an ideal laboratory. It's full of caches, returning users, and all kinds of network environments. The greatest charm of server push lies in its \"proactivity,\" and its greatest regret also stems precisely from this \"proactivity.\" It cannot know whether the browser's cache already quietly holds that style.css file it's preparing to enthusiastically push. For the sake of the ultimate experience for a small portion of first-time visitors, it might waste precious bandwidth for more returning users. The Web's evolution ultimately chose a more prudent path with a more collaborative spirit. It returned decision-making authority to the browser, which knows the situation best. The entire interaction changed from the server's \"I push to you\" to the server's \"I suggest you fetch,\" with the browser making its own judgment. This may not be romantic enough, not extreme enough, but it's more universal and more robust. So, I still miss that ambitious Server Push. It represented a pure pursuit of ultimate performance, a beautiful technical idealism. Although it has quietly faded from the historical stage, the dream about \"speed\" it pointed toward has long been inherited by 103 Early Hints and preload in a more mature, more balanced way.","level":2},{"id":"/2025/11/05/http-2-server-push-is-practically-obsolete#see-also","title":"See Also","titles":["HTTP/2 Server Push Has Effectively \"Died\" - I Miss It"],"content":"Remove HTTP/2 Server Push from Chrome  |  Blog  |  Chrome for DevelopersHTTP/2 Server Push - Wikipedia静态资源递送优化：HTTP/2 和 Server Push | Sukka's BlogModule http.handlers.push - Caddy DocumentationHow to Configure HTTP/2 Server Push on Cloudflare Workers SitesIntent to Remove: HTTP/2 and gQUIC server push html .default .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html.dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}","level":2},{"id":"/2025/07/05/node-sass-migration-to-dart-sass","title":"Migration from node-sass to dart-sass: A Troubleshooting Chronicle","titles":[],"content":"","level":1},{"id":"/2025/07/05/node-sass-migration-to-dart-sass#update-goals","title":"Update Goals","titles":["Migration from node-sass to dart-sass: A Troubleshooting Chronicle"],"content":"node-sass -> sass (dart-sass)Minimize impact, avoid updating other dependency versions unless necessaryBased on the above two conditions, see if we can upgrade the node.js version","level":2},{"id":"/2025/07/05/node-sass-migration-to-dart-sass#reasons-to-abandon-node-sass","title":"Reasons to Abandon node-sass","titles":["Migration from node-sass to dart-sass: A Troubleshooting Chronicle"],"content":"node-sass has been deprecated, dart-sass is the officially recommended successor by Sassnode-sass installation on Windows is very troublesome, requiring both Python 2 and Microsoft Visual C++ on the development machine during npm installationWhen installing node-sass, resources need to be pulled from GitHub, which has a low success rate in certain network environments","level":2},{"id":"/2025/07/05/node-sass-migration-to-dart-sass#current-project-dependency-versions","title":"Current Project Dependency Versions","titles":["Migration from node-sass to dart-sass: A Troubleshooting Chronicle"],"content":"","level":2},{"id":"/2025/07/05/node-sass-migration-to-dart-sass#update-strategy","title":"Update Strategy","titles":["Migration from node-sass to dart-sass: A Troubleshooting Chronicle"],"content":"","level":2},{"id":"/2025/07/05/node-sass-migration-to-dart-sass#nodejs","title":"node.js","titles":["Migration from node-sass to dart-sass: A Troubleshooting Chronicle","Update Strategy"],"content":"Webpack officially doesn't provide the maximum node version supported by webpack 3, and even if webpack officially supports it, related webpack plugins may not.

Even if only the last line is new content, the entire document's DOM gets completely replaced. This leads to two core problems: Performance bottleneck: As Markdown content grows, the overhead of  parsing and DOM reconstruction increases linearly.Lost interaction state: Full refresh wipes out the user's current operation state. Most notably, if you've selected some text, one refresh and the selection is gone! To solve these two problems, we found a chunked rendering solution online—splitting Markdown by two consecutive newlines () into chunks. This way, each update only re-renders the last new chunk, while previous chunks reuse the cache. The benefits are obvious: If the user has selected text in a previous chunk, the selection state won't be lost on the next update (because that chunk hasn't changed).Fewer DOM nodes need re-rendering, naturally improving performance.

By directly comparing and manipulating the real DOM, it updates the view with minimal cost, perfectly solving the performance bottleneck and interaction state loss issues in real-time rendering. However, a fundamental problem has always existed: in Vue's territory, bypassing Vue's Virtual DOM and Diff algorithm to let a third-party library directly \"operate\" on the real DOM always feels somewhat \"unorthodox.\" It's like introducing an old master with a hammer and wrench for manual repairs in a precision automated factory. Although the job is done well, it always feels like it disrupts the original workflow and isn't \"Vue\" enough. So, is there a more elegant, more \"native\" approach that allows us to enjoy precise updates while fully integrating with Vue's ecosystem? With this question in mind, I consulted friends in frontend development groups. If you're building a renderer, your approach isn't the best practice. Each time you update, you generate the full virtual HTML, then optimize performance by subtracting from the HTML. However, the incremental part of each update is clear - why not directly use this incremental part for addition? The incremental part cannot be directly obtained through markdown-it, but a better approach is to transform at this step: first parse the Markdown structure, then use Vue's dynamic rendering capabilities to generate the DOM.

准备的","titles":["为什么我不推荐Manjaro","接下来就是正文"],"content":"AUR和ArchlinuxCN源都是Archlinux用户为Archlinux打包的常用软件，因此所有的软件都是选择Archlinux最新的软件作为依赖来编译/打包的。上文中我们提到过，Manjaro源内的软件会滞后更新。因此AUR和ArchlinuxCN内一些对于依赖版本要求比较苛刻的软件会在Manjaro这个更新比较落后的发行版上不工作。 我知道这听起来会有些荒唐，不过我可以举出一个就发生在不久之前的生动的例子。 Archlinux在2020年10月17日将grpc从1.30更新到了1.32，qv2ray开发者反应迅速，在几个小时内直接更新了基于grpc-1.32的qv2ray，接着是仍然在使用grpc-1.30的Manjaro用户的一片哀嚎。。。 解决方法有很多，比如临时使用Archlinux源把grpc更新到1.32、通过AppImage安装qv2ray等等，但是如你所见，Manjaro用户使用AUR&ArchlinuxCN确实容易出现问题。 附：AUR上需要下载源码的自己编译的包不会碰到依赖的版本问题，但是仍然有部分情况下PKGBUILD会直接因为依赖版本号被写死而编译出错。而ArchlinuxCN清一色是编译好的二进制包，所以Manjaro用户使用ArchlinuxCN相比AUR出问题的几率更加大一点。 此外，他们延迟两周，并不是在测试 Arch 包打包本身的质量，而是在测试他们拿来 Arch 的包和他们自己乱改的核心包之间的兼容性。以下内容来自于一位 Archlinux Trusted User manjaro 這個分三個 channel 延遲兩週的做法，原因出於兩點他們處理打包方面非常存疑的做法他們想要自己打包一部分非常核心的包，包括 glibc 內核 驅動 systemd他們不想重新打整個發行版所有包，想直接從 Arch 拿二進制來用。這兩個做法單獨只做一個沒啥事，放一起做就很容易導致他們自己打包的核心包破壞了二進制兼容，以至於他們從 Arch 拿的二進制包壞掉。所以他們延遲兩週，並不是在測試 Arch 包打包本身的質量，而是在測試他們拿來 Arch 的包和他們自己亂改的核心包之間的兼容性。Arch 本身有一套機制保證 Arch 打包放出來的時候是測試好相互兼容的，被他們替換掉幾個核心包之後就不一定兼容了，他們也沒有渠道涉足 Arch 內部打包機制，從 Arch 組織內部了解什麼時候放出包之類的信息。綜合這些情況，對他們來說合理的做法就是延遲一陣子讓他們自己的人測試一下。所以作為證據你看他們的打包者開發者很少會向 Arch 上游反饋測試打包遇到的問題…因為 manjaro unstable 和 manjaro testing 會遇到的問題大部分都是他們自己造成的問題而不是 Arch 的問題。要是他們誠實地把這個情況傳達給他們用戶的話我不責怪他們。Arch整個滾動發布的生態也不利於下游發行版。Debian 這種上游打包時可以約定版本兼容性的範圍，可以鎖 abi ，Arch 打包本身就不考慮這些，作為Arch下游就的確很難操作。我反感 manjaro 的點在於他們把這種難看的做法宣傳成他們的優勢，還為了這個看起來是優勢故意去抹黑 Arch 作為上游的打包質量…做法就很難看了。—— farseerfc","level":4},{"id":"/2021/01/01/why-i-dont-recommend-manjaro#manjaro-没有-archive-源","title":"Manjaro 没有 Archive

其一是：rpm在打包时的默认状态下，会使用  命令判断文件，如果是二进制的，用ldd判断依赖；如果是脚本，过滤文件中对应的 // 语句，以此来找出内部依赖。**这固然是个非常贴心的小善举，**能够确保软件正常运行，但完全有可能造成比较奇怪的问题。比如我本次打包中rpm自作聪明地给我添加了一个的依赖，这东西整个Fedora自带的四个源里都不存在，在安装测试的时候出现了找不到依赖的情况。想我这种添加了找不到依赖的情况还算是运气好的，之前听说有人在使用opensuse的某个私人源的时候发现安装网易云音乐居然吧wps-office都给依赖上了，我想就是rpm自动检测到了网易云需要某个库，而wps恰好自带了这个库而导致的依赖误报。在Archlinux中，我们有一个叫的小工具能够使用类似的方法检测软件运行时可能所需要的内部依赖，但他并不会默认启用，更不会自说自话的就直接把他添加为依赖，连一声也不吭。 其二是：rpm检测新增包内文件是否与系统已安装的软件包内的文件因为使用相同路径而冲突时，不仅会核对是否有冲突的同路径同名文件，他还会核对文件夹的文件占用情况。这说起来可能会有些抽象，我举个例子。在Fedora中，路径是被这个包所占有的，所以其他包在打包时是不能直接使用、、甚至来限定包内文件的范围的（也就是上面spec文件中的%files区域）。而我在第一次打包时，想要直接打包下的所有文件，于是%files就直接填写了作为限定，安装时提示和被这个包所占用，文件冲突。为此我还特意去仔细对比了Fedora自带的和我这个是否有冲突的文件，实则证明并没有，只是单纯这个检测机制过于死板罢了。而在Archlinux中，pacman安装时只会检测包内的文件是否与系统内的现有文件路径产生冲突，而不会非常无意义的去限定哪个文件夹是属于哪个包的。","level":3},{"id":"/2021/07/23/build-a-rpm-package-from-aur-with-archlinux#附上本文的参考资料","title":"附上本文的参考资料","titles":["来，从AUR给Fedora偷个包","准备打包"],"content":"为了避免源网页失效，我特意去互联网档案馆做了备份

logo 将会始终包含小狐狸，他们没有消除狐狸的计划。作为反击这一 meme 行动的一部分，Mozilla 修改了Firefox Nightly 的 logo，将著名的网络 meme 狗币中的柴犬图像与红色小狐狸 logo 整合在一起。如果你下载安装 Nightly 版本，你会看到狗狗在看着你。 这只狗是非常可爱，大概是长下图这个样子。 但是我是一个将Firefox当成主浏览器的用户，咱不可能去用Nightly，所以我就打算把我这里这只稳定版的红色小狐狸 换成上面的那只狗。 通过直接写入用户目录下的icon可以在不覆盖浏览器原图标、不给包管理器惹麻烦的情况下实现我们的目标，所以，代码如下 html pre.shiki code .sW2Sy, html code.shiki

Google 自家产品矩阵的强推，VP9 在 YouTube、WebRTC 乃至 Chrome 浏览器中迅速站稳了脚跟。特别是在 AV1 普及之前，VP9 几乎是网页视频播放领域的事实标准，甚至逼得苹果这个“编解码俱乐部元老”在 macOS 11 Big Sur 和 iOS 14 上的 Safari 破天荒地加入了 VP9 支持（尽管 VP9 in webm 的支持稍晚一些，具体见上表）。 VP9

的短板。Google 官方提供的开源实现 libvpx，速度比不上 x264/x265 等老牌选手，在缺乏硬件加速的场景下，仍然属于“关机前压一宿”的那种体验。不过相比 AV1 的 libaom-av1，VP9 至少还能算“可用”，适合轻量化应用、实时通信或是对压制速度敏感的用户，而早在 7 代 Intel 的 Kaby Lake 系列产品就已经引入了 VP9 的硬件编码支持，各家硬件厂商对

迅速成为从网络视频、蓝光光盘到直播、监控乃至手机录像的默认选择。如果你打开一个视频网站的视频流、下载一个在线视频、剪辑一个 vlog，大概率都绕不开 H.264 的身影。 H.264 的最大优势在于——兼容性无敌。不夸张地说，只要是带屏幕的设备，就能播放 H.264 视频。软解？早在十几年前的浏览器和媒体播放器中就已普及；硬解？从 Intel Sandy Bridge、NVIDIA Fermi、AMD VLIW4 这些“史前”架构开始就已加入对 H.264 的完整支持——你甚至可以在树莓派、智能冰箱上流畅播放 H.264 视频。 虽然 H.264 同样存在和 H.265 相同的专利问题，但其授权策略明显更温和——MPEG LA 提供的专利池授权门槛较低，且不向免费网络视频收取费用，使得包括 Chromium、Firefox 在内的浏览器都默认集成了 H.264 的软解功能。Apple 和 Microsoft 更是早早将其作为视频编码和解码的第一公民，Safari 和 Edge 天生支持 H.264，不存在任何兼容性烦恼。 当然，作为一项 20 多年前的技术，H.264 在压缩效率上已经明显落后于 VP9、HEVC 和 AV1。相同画质下，H.264 的码率要比 AV1 高出 30～50%，在追求极致带宽利用或存储节省的应用场景中就显得有些力不从心。然而在今天这个“能播比好看更重要”的现实环境中，H.264 依然是默认方案，是“稳健老哥”的代名词。 所以，即便 AV1、HEVC、VP9 各有亮点，H.264 依旧凭借“老、稳、全”三大核心竞争力，在 2025 年依然牢牢占据着视频生态链的中枢地位——只要这个世界还有浏览器不支持 AV1（可恶的 Safari

是的，这是使用php实现的随机图片api，托管于vercel，你可以在aya的博客上找到我使用的代码。具体配置方式我不再赘述。 然而，我们还需要解决一个问题: php在哪里运行？ 如果你拥有自己的服务器，在国内访问速度毫不逊色，那就好办了，直接扔自己服务器上即可。然而，我并没有。我需要找到一个在国内访问速度给力的地方来部署我的api，以确保访客在打开我的博客时可以在第一时间获取到图片的真实链接并开始加载。 起初，我将其部署在我的好朋友(你可以猜猜他是谁)的国内vps上，访问速度自然不用说。然而，他的服务器不支持https，这就导致使用chrome访问的时候chrome不会自动访问我的api，博客顶部一片惨蓝。。。 随后，我使用的是000webhost提供的虚拟主机，国内访问起来也还不错，大概正常运行了半个月左右的时间，然后莫名开始502了。我懂，作为不交钱的白嫖用户应该自觉滚蛋了，这点觉悟咱还是有。 随后，我找到了目前的方案——vercel vercel是被我用来部署静态网页的，但我没想到他也能支持php。参考了vercel-php项目后，我大致了解了整个仓库结构。 php和附带的资源文件(如果有的话)一定要放到api文件夹下才能够正常被vercel识别。 以下附 html pre.shiki code .s5ixo, html code.shiki

之前对于electron懵懵懂懂的时候就把 wolai 给打包上了 AUR ，那会儿年少无知，也不懂得把内置的 electron 拆开来换成系统内置的以节省空间。前一阵子给CN源打完 Motrix 以后突然想起来自己在 AUR 上还有维护一个叫 wolai 的electron 应用，于是打算把软件内置的 electron 拆出来。尝试使用  命令启动的时候发现了以下的问题。 虽然这个报错无关紧要，直接右上角叉掉也不影响软件正常使用，但是就这样推上 AUR 似乎有些不太妥当。于是使用搜索引擎查找答案。 发现是使用系统自带的 electron 启动时，app.asar 内置的一个叫  的模块在自动检测更新时会误认为我们此时处于开发模式，于是会尝试读取 app.asar 内部的 dev-app-update.yml 以查询更新。1 但问题在于这个 app.asar 并不是 wolai 开发者在开发时使用 development 模式打出来的包，应该是 production ，所以内置的那个文件名叫 app-update.yml ，少了个dev 前缀，就很尴尬。 以下内容来自一篇简书的文章2 所以调试的时候可以建一个default-app.yml文件放在D:\\hzhh123\\workspace\\vue-work\\electron-demo1\\node_modules\\electron\\dist\\resources\\default_app.asar

npm 中有一个叫 asar 的程序可以帮助我们解压缩 app.asar。我这里直接将内容搬过来 解压压缩：如果压缩文件存在，则会被替换 原文是让我们直接使用 npm 下载安装 asar 程序，然而这就会让打包过程变得很复杂，所幸 Archlinux 官方源中已经将这个程序打完了，我们可以直接将 asar 写入 makedepends。 大概就写成了这个样子。

Encrypt 这一举动的背后，是人们对 OCSP（在线证书状态协议）长久以来累积的不满。OCSP 作为一种实时查询证书有效性的方式，最初的设想很美好：当浏览器访问一个网站时，它可以向 CA（证书颁发机构） 的 OCSP 服务器发送一个简短的请求，询问该证书是否仍然有效。这似乎比下载一个巨大的 CRL（证书吊销列表） 要高效得多。 然而，OCSP 在实际应用中暴露出众多缺陷： 首先是性能问题。尽管单个请求很小，但当数百万用户同时访问网站时，OCSP 服务器需要处理海量的实时查询。这不仅给 CA 带来了巨大的服务器压力，也增加了用户访问网站的延迟。如果 OCSP 服务器响应缓慢甚至宕机，浏览器可能会因为无法确认证书状态而中断连接，或者为了用户体验而不得不“睁一只眼闭一只眼”，这都削弱了 OCSP 的安全性。 更严重的是隐私问题。每一次 OCSP 查询，都相当于向 CA 报告了用户的访问行为。这意味着 CA 能够知道某个用户在何时访问了哪个网站。虽然 OCSP 查询本身不包含个人身份信息，但将这些信息与 IP 地址等数据结合起来，CA 完全可以建立起用户的浏览习惯画像。对于重视隐私的用户和开发者来说，这种“无声的监视”是不可接受的。即使 CA 故意不保留这些信息，地区法律也可能强制 CA 收集这些信息。 再者，OCSP  还存在设计上的安全缺陷。由于担心连接超时影响用户体验，浏览器通常默认采用 soft-fail 机制：一旦无法连接 OCSP  服务器，便会选择放行而非阻断连接。攻击者恰恰可以利用这一点，通过阻断客户端与 OCSP  服务器之间的通信，使查询始终超时，从而轻松绕过证书状态验证。","level":2},{"id":"/2025/10/16/how-s-mozilla-crlite-going-now#ocsp-装订-ocsp-stapling","title":"OCSP 装订 (OCSP stapling)","titles":["后 OCSP 时代，浏览器如何应对证书吊销新挑战","OCSP

的隐私和性能问题并非秘密，浏览器厂商们早就开始了各自的探索。2012 年，Chrome 默认禁用了 CRLs、OCSP 检查，转向自行设计的证书校验机制。 众所周知，吊销列表可以非常庞大。如果浏览器需要下载和解析一个完整的全球吊销列表，那将是一场性能灾难（Mozilla 团队在今年的博客中提到，从 3000 个活跃的 CRL 下载的文件大小将达到 300MB）。Chromium 团队通过分析历史数据发现，大多数被吊销的证书属于少数高风险类别，例如证书颁发机构（CA）本身被攻破、或者某些大型网站的证书被吊销。基于此洞察，CRLSets 采取了以下策略： 分层吊销：Chromium 不会下载所有被吊销的证书信息，而是由 Google 团队维护一个精简的、包含“最重要”吊销信息的列表。这个列表会定期更新并通过 Chrome 浏览器更新推送给用户。精简高效：这个列表体积非常小，目前大概只有 600KB。它包含了那些一旦被滥用就会造成大规模安全事故的证书，例如 CA 的中间证书、或者一些知名网站（如 Google、Facebook）的证书。牺牲部分安全性：这种方案的缺点也很明显——它无法覆盖所有的证书吊销情况。对于一个普通网站的证书被吊销，CRLSets 大概率无法检测到。根据 Mozilla 今年的博客所说，CRLSets 只包含了 1%~2% 的未过期的被吊销证书信息。 虽然 CRLSets 是一种“不完美”的解决方案，但它在性能和可用性之间找到了一个平衡点。它确保了用户在访问主流网站时的基础安全，同时避免了 OCSP 带来的性能和隐私开销。对于 Chromium 而言，与其追求一个在现实中难以完美实现的 OCSP 方案，不如集中精力解决最紧迫的安全威胁。","level":2},{"id":"/2025/10/16/how-s-mozilla-crlite-going-now#firefox-的方案从-crls-到-crlite","title":"Firefox 的方案：从 CRLs 到 CRLite","titles":["后 OCSP 时代，浏览器如何应对证书吊销新挑战"],"content":"与 Chromium 的“只取一瓢”策略不同，Firefox 的开发者们一直在寻找一种既能保证全面性，又能解决性能问题的方案。 为了解决这个问题，Mozilla 提出了一个创新的方案：CRLite。CRLite 的设计理念是通过哈希函数和布隆过滤器等数据结构，将庞大的证书吊销列表压缩成一个小巧、可下载且易于本地验证的格式。 CRLite 的工作原理可以简单概括为： 数据压缩：CA 定期生成其全部吊销证书的列表。服务器处理：Mozilla 的服务器会收集这些列表，并使用加密哈希函数和布隆过滤器等技术，将所有吊销证书的信息编码成一个非常紧凑的数据结构。客户端验证：浏览器下载这个压缩文件，当访问网站时，只需本地对证书进行哈希计算，然后查询这个本地文件，就能快速判断该证书是否已被吊销。 与 CRLSets 相比，CRLite 的优势在于它能够实现对所有吊销证书的全面覆盖，同时保持极小的体积。更重要的是，它完全在本地完成验证，这意味着浏览器无需向任何第三方服务器发送请求，从而彻底解决了 OCSP 的隐私问题。 Firefox 当前的策略为每 12 小时对 CRLite 数据进行一次增量更新，每日的下载数据大约为 300KB；每 45 天进行一次全量的快照同步，下载数据约为 4MB。 Mozilla 开放了他们的数据看板，你可以在这里找到近期的 CRLite 数据大小：https://yardstick.mozilla.org/dashboard/snapshot/c1WZrxGkNxdm9oZp7xVvGUEFJCELfApN 自 2025 年 4 月 1 日发布的 Firefox Desktop 137 版本起，Firefox 开始逐步以 CRLite 替换 OCSP 校验；同年 8 月 19 日，Firefox Desktop 142 针对 DV 证书正式弃用 OCSP 检验。 CRLite 已经成为 Firefox 未来证书吊销验证的核心方案，它代表了对性能、隐私和安全性的全面追求。","level":2},{"id":"/2025/10/16/how-s-mozilla-crlite-going-now#后-ocsp-时代的展望","title":"后 OCSP

CRLite 这一技术创新，试图在全面性、隐私和性能三者之间找到最佳的解决方案。 这些方案的共同点是：将证书吊销验证从实时在线查询（OCSP）转变为本地化验证，从而规避了 OCSP 固有的性能瓶颈和隐私风险。 未来，证书吊销的生态系统将不再依赖单一的、中心化的 OCSP 服务器。取而代之的是，一个更加多元、分布式和智能化的新时代正在到来。OCSP 这一技术可能逐渐被淘汰，但它所试图解决的“证书吊销”这一核心安全问题，将永远是浏览器和网络安全社区关注的重点。","level":2},{"id":"/2025/10/16/how-s-mozilla-crlite-going-now#参见","title":"参见","titles":["后 OCSP 时代，浏览器如何应对证书吊销新挑战"],"content":"CRLite: Fast,

年不止有世界末日，还有 IE 10。随着 IE 10 在当年 9 月 4 日发布，execCommand 家族迎来了两个新的成员—— copy/cut 命令（此说法来自 Chrome 的博客，而 MDN 认为 IE 9 就已经支持了）。三年之后，随着 Google Chrome 在 2015 年 4 月 14 日的发布的 42 版本对 execCommand 的 copy/cut

Github 的变更记录，这个 API 在 2020 年 1~2 月被首次标记为 Obsolete（过时的），在 2021 年 1 月被首次标记为 Deprecated（已弃用），并附上了红色 Section Background Color 提示开发者该 API 可能随时无法正常工作。但截至本文发布，所有的常用浏览器都保留着对该 API 的兼容，起码在 copy 命令下是这样的。 这个 API 被广泛应用在了太多站点，以至于移除对该 API 的支持将会导致大量的站点异常，我想各家浏览器内核在短期内恐怕都没有动力以丢失兼容性为代价去移除这个 API，这也意味着这个创建一个不可见的 dom 代替用户选中文本并执行 execCommand

的姗姗来迟，前端开发者门总算喘了口气，再一次得到了一个主流浏览器通用的复制方案。 那么 execCommand 明明已经实现了纯 js 实现的复制文本到剪切板了，为什么我们还需要 Clipboard API ？或者说，这个特意去实现的 Clipboard API 到底有什么优势？ 传统的 execCommand 方案在使用的时候通常需要创建一个临时的不可见的 DOM，放入文本、用 JS 选中文本、执行 copy 命令。我们暂且不说这种 hacky 的方式在代码编写时是多么不优雅，但一个使用 JS 去选中文本这个操作就会修改用户当前的文本选择状态，在某些时候导致一些用户体验的下降。Clipboard API 是异步的，这意味着其在复制大量文本时不会阻塞主线程。Clipboard API 提供了更多的能力，比如  和  允许对剪切板读写更复杂的数据，比如富文本或图片。Clipboard API 具有更现代、更明确的权限控制—— write 操作需要由用户的主动操作来调用，read 操作则需要用户在浏览器 UI 上明确授予权限。这些权限控制给予了用户更大的控制权，因此，当 execCommand 退出历史的舞台后，WEB 的安全性将得到进一步提升。 不过在现阶段，

execCommand 实现复制到剪切板的操作，项目的 owner 希望开发者自行使用  来判断用户的浏览器是否支持 execCommand 方案，并根据命令执行的返回值自行安排成功/失败后的动作。。 不过让我感到奇怪的是，clipboard.js 在实例化时会要求开发者传入一个 DOM 选择（或者是 HTML 元素/元素列表）。它一定要有一个实体的 html 元素，用设置事件监听器来触发复制操作，而不是提供一个 js 函数让开发者来调用——尽管这不是来自 execCommand 的限制。示例如下 对，就一行 js 就能给所有带有 btn class 的 dom 加上监听器。或许这就是为什么这个仓库能获得 34.1k star 的原因，在 2015 年那个大多数人还在用三件套写前端的时代，clipboard.js

只是“提示”，浏览器可以根据自身缓存情况、网络状况等因素决定是否采纳该提示。这就解决了服务端推送最大的痛点——服务器无法知晓客户端缓存而导致推送冗余资源。兼容性更好：它是一种更轻量、更易于中间代理服务器理解和传递的机制。 103 Early Hints 对动态博客很有意义，在后端进行计算之前先把需要的资源通过 103 响应告知浏览器，让浏览器先取回其他资源，再等待后端返回最终的

http 请求控制向日葵智能插座 C2 的开关状态。但这还远远不够，我自己是小米生态链的忠实用户，在宿舍里也接入了四五个米家的智能设备，因此我想把这个智能插座接入米家，实现离家时一键关闭。 在阅读小米IoT开发者平台的接入文档后，我发现米家对于个人开发者并不友好，接入文档大部分要完成企业认证以后才能实现。在谷歌一番搜索过后，我发现了通过假设 Home Assistant 后通过巴法云接入米家的方案。但我眼下就这一个非米家的智能家具，暂时还不想去碰 Home Assistant 那套体系。 因此我便找上了巴法云。在巴法云的官网中提到，他们是「专注物联网设备接入&一站式解决方案」，对于个人开发者，目前平台免费使用。网站的文档虽然并不优雅美观，却透露出实用主义的气息，针对接入提供了 TCP 长连接和 MQTT 两种方案，看着就很适合实现我的需求。 在巴法云文档中的「五分钟入门」那一栏介绍了远程控制的业务逻辑: 如果单片机订阅了一个主题，手机往这个主题推送个消息指令，单片机由于订阅了这个主题，就可以收到发往这个主题的消息，就可以达到手机控制单片机的目的。 所以我需要在巴法云的控制台创建一个针对于智能插座的主题，让我局域网内的一台设备订阅这个主题。接入米家以后，米家需要控制向日葵的智能插座时就向巴法云的这个主题推送一条消息，局域网内的设备就能接收到推送消息，进而调用智能插座的 api 实现远程开关。在这里，我选择使用一台刷了 Armbian 的 N1 作为局域网内的转发器。整个控制流程看上去是下面这个样子: 我并不知道 tcp 长连接的数据传输应该如何实现，但看起来 MQTT 是一个比较成熟的协议，因此我选择使用 MQTT 作为巴法云和 N1 之间的通讯协议。 在巴法云的控制台，选择 MQTT 设备云，创建一个新的主题，注意需要以 001~009 结尾，否则在米家里看不见创建的这个主题。 当主题名字后三位是001时为插座设备。当主题名字后三位是002时为灯泡设备。当主题名字后三位是003时为风扇设备。当主题名字后三位是004时为传感器设备。当主题名字后三位是005时为空调设备。当主题名字后三位是006时为开关设备。当主题名字后三位是009时为窗帘设备。当主题名字为其他时，默认为普通主题节点，不会同步到米家。 此时，我便可以在手机的米家中找到巴法云并接入这个插座。 至此，米家那边的接入已经完成了，虽然没法在米家中找到对应设备的卡片，但是可以在小爱同学的小爱训练计划中找到对应的设备。 我们还需要让本地的 N1 盒子使用 MQTT 协议订阅巴法云的消息。

用电记录推算宿舍上次烧水时间","titles":[],"content":"我宿舍里入口处有一张公用的桌子，上面有一个烧水壶。根据生活经验，当用手摸烧水壶外壳能感受到明显热量时，水壶内的水大概是两小时内烧的，绝对能喝；但如果用手摸烧水壶外壳感受不到明显热量时，水壶内的水就不知道是什么时候烧的了，可能是三小时前，也可能是三天前。此时，在不寻求外部科学仪器介入的情况下，唯一能做的是询问寝室成员上一次水是谁烧的，是什么时候烧的。但寝室成员并不总是能够及时回答，可能在睡觉，也可能不在寝室里，还有可能出现记忆错乱。 因此，我们需要一种可靠的方案获取上一次烧水时间。 前两天陪黄老板出门吃宵夜的时候和他提到了这个难题，我提出在烧水壶附近加装物理按钮，按动时向局域网内的 HomeServer 发送请求记录准确的烧水时间。他提出可以在烧水壶前加装智能插座，使用智能插座的耗电量来推算上一次烧水时间。这是一个可行方案，上次烧水时间不需要分钟级的精准度，小时级的精准度在这个需求上完全够用，这是一个更好的方案。 在「使用 Root 后的安卓手机获取向日葵智能插座 C2 的开关 api」这篇文章中，我有过抓包向日葵官方 app 的流量数据的经验，这一次直接故技重施。很可惜，我发现用电量数据并不能直接从局域网内向智能插座获取，必须要从向日葵官方的服务器拉下来。其实想想也知道，用电数据一旦精确到小时级，日积月累下来会对硬件的存储提出一定的挑战，而比较合理的方案就是由硬件向官方的服务器每小时通信一次记录下来。 不过好消息是，官方服务器的这个接口并没有进行鉴权，不需要进行额外的操作，一条 curl 命令都能下载下来。 SN 码也不需要自己去抓包，直接在官方应用的设备关于页面就能看到。 json 数据的结构很明显，最外层是一个 Array，里面有若干个 object consume: 这段时间消耗的用电量，单位 Whstarttime: 开始时间，unix 时间戳endtime: 结束时间，unix 时间戳index: 智能插座的第几个孔位（为插排预留的参数，智能插座只有 0 这一个位置） 所以我们要做的就是每小时下载一次这个 json 文件，需要时从 json 中寻找上一次用电量较高的小时，取那个小时的 starttime 时间戳转换为东八区人类可读的时间即可。 至于每小时下载的任务，我这里是使用 crontab + curl 命令实现的，用 python 写个死循环跑也可以。 那么数据都取到了，剩下的就是人机交互的部分，这部分夸张点的可以写 web，写小程序，甚至写个安卓应用挂个桌面插件，想怎么做都可以。我这里就单纯将数据接入 qqbot 扔到了宿舍群，简单写了个关键词触发。 html pre.shiki code .sAdtL, html code.shiki

cloudflare workers 用上瘾了 在「使用 Github Action 更新用于 rpm 打包的 spec 文件」一文中，我利用 Github Action 实现了自动化的 spec 版本号更新，配合 Fedora Copr 的 webhook 就可以实现 Copr 软件包更新的自动化构建。看似很完美，但缺少了一个构建状态的监控机制，这导致出现构建错误的时候我不能及时得到通知（无论构建错误是 spec 本身的问题或者是构建时的网络环境问题）。 西木野羰基 提出 notifications.fedoraproject.org 可以配置通知，Filters 的 Applications 选项中有 copr，但很可惜，实测没有效果。这里的通知配置的似乎只是邮件的过滤规则——如果 copr 本来就没打算构建失败的时候给你发邮件，那即使建立了过滤规则，依然是不可能收到邮件的。 不过好在 Fedora Copr 本身有非常完备的 api 文档， 这个 API 能用来获取软件包最新的构建情况。 因此，我们就可以通过 Cloudflare 的 cronjob 定时请求这个接口，查询是否有软件包构建失败。 先来编写打请求的部分 随后编写通知部分，我这里采用的是飞书的 webhook 机器人 最后就是 cronjob 的调用部分和构建状态解析部分 随后在 Cloudflare Workers 的 Settings 部分设置好 Cron 表达式即可，我这里选择在每小时的 55 分进行一次检测，这样下来一天只会消耗 24 次 workers 次数，简直毫无压力。 缺点: 我懒得使用持久化数据库记录软件包构建的成功状态，这会导致出现一个包构建失败后，每隔 1 小时都会有一条提醒，什么夺命连环 call。我目前不想修复这个问题，要不然还是降低 cron 的触发频率好了。 html pre.shiki code .sLKXg, html code.shiki

部署，这使得我们可以直接在 Github Pages、Vercel 等平台直接部署上我的博客，如果用上  或者非洲国家免费域名就可以实现零成本的博客部署。 当然，我现在的博客并非是零成本搭建的，如你所见，我购入了印度国别域名  来凑出 竹林 的谐音。并在 Github Pages、Vercel 等平台的访问质量每况愈下的情况下又购入了位于香港的 VPS，这就引申出了今天的内容——介绍我博客的部署方案。 我的博客是使用 HK vps + Github Pages 两处部署实现的，通过 dnspod 免费版的域名分境内/外解析实现了分流。当境内的访客访问我的博客时，他们将会被解析到香港的 vps 上以获得更好的体验，而境外的访客将会被解析到 Github pages，毕竟 Github Pages 在境外的速度并不慢，并且稳定性肯定比我这小鸡要好得多。 不过关于通过 dns 解析分流这件事，之前看城南旧事的博客中有提到可以使用境外的 GeoScaling 完成，其免费支持全球分as、城市、经纬等智能解析，也支持自编辑脚本，看起来以后可以去试一试。 而 Hexo 框架最被人诟病的一点是更新麻烦。这一点不可否认，使用  生成静态网页文件再部署到服务器上的过程在一台新设备上是不小的工作量，它涉及 git、nodejs 的安装，涉及到 ssh key 和 rsync，整个环境的搭建就要废上不小的工夫。 在博客内容的更新方面，我选择了将整个 Hexo 的 workdir 全部上传到 github，使用 Github Action 帮助我同时完成静态页面的生成和 Github Pages 及 vps 的部署工作。具体的代码可以直接见我的 GIthub 仓库，我在这里简单讲下思路。 安装 nodejs这个没什么可说的，有现成的 Github Action 去完成这件事，我这边直接使用了。使用 npm/yarn 安装相关依赖这个直接跑  即可。为每个文件重新设定最后修改时间这一步其实是挺重要的，Hexo框架生成每篇文章的最后修改时间的依据是该文件的最后修改时间，而对于 Github Action 的容器来说，每一个文件都刚刚被下载下来，都是最新的，这就会导致你的每一篇文章每次部署时都会被认为刚才修改过。我们这边可以直接使用 git 记录的时间来作为文件的最后修改时间。（参考 Sea's Blog）设置时区读我的博客的人应该大多都是东八区的人，那我们应当把 Github Action 容器的时区设置为东八区，和自己  时所使用的设备的时间保持一致，否则某些文章的日期可能会发生一天的偏移。生成静态网页文件部署到 Github Pages使用 初始化 Github Action 容器上的 ssh 私钥应当在 Github 仓库的设置里先新建一个 secret，填入自己的 ssh 私钥（更加标准的做法应当是为 github action 专门生成一对 ssh 密钥，将公钥上传到自己的 vps，将私钥上传到 Github 仓库的 secret 中）。我这边直接从点墨阁那边抄了点代码直接用。使用 hexo 的 deploy 插件调用 rsync 将静态文件上传到自己服务器的对应目录（static server 你应当已经设置好了） 注: 本篇博客中引用的所有博客页面均在  进行了存档，如后续遇到页面打不开的问题请自行前往查询存档。 html pre.shiki code .sAdtL, html

暂时停留在 7.0.3 版本，如果后续有问题可以更新到 ^7 版本中最新的 7.3.1 版本。","level":3},{"id":"/2025/07/05/node-sass-migration-to-dart-sass#dart-sass","title":"dart-sass","titles":["node-sass 迁移至 dart-sass

https://stopthemingmy.app/ 请从头到尾阅读这封信。这份信针对的是那些在默认设置下使用第三方主题破坏软件体验的发行版，而不是那些试图使用第三方主题美化自己桌面的用户。（原文中出现的是tinkerers，意为修补匠） 我们是 GNOME 平台的应用开发者与设计者，我们为自己的成果感到自豪，并努力确保我们的应用能够为人们提供良好的体验。 然而不幸的是，在许多情况下，我们所有在软件的设计、开发、测试上所做出努力都因为第三方主题而变得徒劳无功。 注: 这些例子纯粹只是用于说明问题，并不针对个别主题。所以，主题开发者们别多想。❤️ 当然，还有些不那么直接的后果，包括: 在GNOME软件中心或Flathub 中使用的截图( Appstream Screenshots )中的UI会和你实际安装以后的UI看上去完全不同，这使得这些截图失去了原有的意义。如果系统的UI元素和用户帮助文档中出现的元素不同，用户帮助文档将会极大地丢失原有意义。 这些博客文章更详细地解释了主题化的一些问题： GTK Stylesheets — Restyling apps at scaleApp Icons — Linux Themes & Third-Party Icons 这就是为什么我们心平气和地要求我们的软件不要被主题化。 它们是被上游所使用的（即默认的） GNOME 样式表、图标和字体 所构建和测试的，因此它们在用户的系统上应该是原汁原味的。 虽然我们可以直接在我们的应用程序中禁用主题，但我们不想这么做。 我们认为技术性的解决方案可能不会有效，因为这不是技术问题。 在技术上，我们希望软件可以在没有人工干预的情况下被自动地重新设计，但这到目前为止仍然是个幻想。在这种技术现状被改善之前，这种（应用被主题搞炸）的情况几乎不可能被解决。因此，我们正试图通过这封信向大家告知这种情况，并尽自己的一份力量。 如果你想要美化你自己的系统，我们没有意见。然而，如果你改变了诸如图标、样式表等东西，你应当意识到你的行为不会得到支持（应该是指不会得到社区的帮助）。您遇到的任何问题都应直接报告给主题开发者，而不是软件开发者。 作为一个平台，我们坚信GTK应当停止强制默认在所有软件使用同一个样式表（也就是说应该可以为不同的软件指定不同的GTK样式）。应用程序不必通过把样式表写死来避免这种情况，而是应该使用平台样式表（系统提供的样式表），除非他们魔改了样式表以加入其他内容。 我们意识到这是一个复杂的问题，但假设每个应用程序都适用于每个样式表同样也是一个糟糕的默认设置。 如果你是更改了系统样式表和图标的发行版的开发人员，希望你重新考虑此决定。 在没有任何 QA 的情况下更改第三方应用程序是鲁莽的，并且在任何其他平台上都是不可接受的。 您的行为对我们这些应用程序开发人员造成了很大的伤害，并且正在损害除了您的发行版以外的整个软件生态。 我们理解发行版需要脱颖而出来吸引用户。但是，我们敦促您想办法在不剥夺我们代理权的情况下做到这一点。 我们厌倦了当人们告诉我们「这个主题魔改得还不错」时，我们必须为我们从未打算支持的设置做额外的工作。你绝对不会对 Blender、Atom、Telegram 或其他第三方应用程序做出这样的魔改。我们的应用程序使用 GTK 并不意味着我们可以接受别人对它们的魔改。 由于你要使用 GNOME 平台开发，我们预设「你希望这个软件生态是健康的」。如果现实确实如此，我们要求您停止使用主题装饰我们的软件的这一行为。 署名, Alexander Mikhaylenko\nMaintainer of GamesAvi Wadhwa\nMaintainer of OrganizerBilal Elmoussaoui\nMaintainer of Authenticator, Icon

webdriver 对象的时候异常缓慢，等了半分钟以后蹲到一个报错如下: 我才发现 selenium 试图访问 https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/latest 且访问失败了。仔细阅读了 selenium 项目的文档发现新版本的 selenium 会尝试自动下载 webdriver: As of Selenium 4.6, Selenium downloads the correct driver for you. You shouldn’t need to do anything. 表面上看上去我不需要做任何事情，但项目组忽略了中国大陆的网络环境。 服务是要在境内的云服务器上跑的，我也不敢开代理，现在比较靠谱的方案是我去手动指定 Firefox 的 geckodriver，避免 selenium 去帮我自动下载一份。在 python-selenium 的官方文档中是让我们创建 Firefox 的 webdriver 时去传入一个  的关键词参数，可惜这是过时的用法，应该是维护者还没来得及更新文档。 随后便在 stackoverflow 上找到了新版 selenium 手动指定 Chrome 的 chromedriver 的方法 原文给的是 chrome 的方案，但 Firefox 的方案基本也是一致的，应该也是去创建一个 service 对象，猜一猜就能猜到。 手动指定

来自 2022 年的竹林: 我是真没想到去年 tuna 的网络负载只有这点的。2022 年的负载图在下面附上，已经翻了一倍不止了 因此，我们也就不难理解为什么tuna近些年来经常出现断流等一系列问题了。 客观上 TUNA 和 UTSC

稳定性。告警服务本身必须要比我们的主后端更加稳定，这是告警服务的基础。针对现有服务的侵入性低。告警服务不能影响到现有服务，最好能够完全分离开来，不应当部署在同一台服务器上。开发快速。整个服务需要尽快落地，因为现有的服务在一周内出现了三次故障，且由于主动的监控告警机制的缺失，我们每次都要等服务 down 机的两小时后才意识到服务挂掉了，如果真在考试周这个使用高峰期内再出现这样的故障不容允许的（用户需要查询考场信息）。尽可能低的运维成本。没什么好解释的，谁也不希望一个告警服务占用太多的运维成本，无论是人力上的还是资源上的。","level":2},{"id":"/2025/01/18/service-status-monitor-based-on-cloudflare-workers#技术选型","title":"技术选型","titles":["基于

调用额度，本身的服务在线率也过硬，唯一的缺点可能就是海外节点访问国内服务器的延迟过高了。不过考虑到我们探测的是在线情况而非延迟情况，倒也不是不能接受。 由于服务特性的关系，我们容许一定的访问失败概率。比如五次访问中如果有两三次失败，我们也认为线路是通的，可能只是教务系统的土豆快熟了。因此并不是每一次失败的探测都需要进行告警。另外，我们还需要记录当前的服务状态，一旦服务被认定为下线状态，后续探测失败我们就不再进行告警，直到我们重新判定服务状态为上线（即每段连续的下线时间都只触发一次告警）。Cloudflare Worker 是一种 serverless 服务，且每次执行探测任务的可能都不是同一个 Cloudflare 的边缘节点，因此我们没法使用变量在内存中记录目前的服务状态，需要引入外部数据库来完成短期内的数据存储。 在数据库上，我们必须选择 Cloudflare 自家的在线数据库服务，通过 Cloudflare 自己内部的网络传输数据库查询结果才能得到尽可能低的延迟。在一番考量过后，KV 数据库和 SQL 数据库中，我果断选择了 Cloudflare D1 这个 SQL 数据库（本质是 SQLite），D1 数据库以更长的查询时间换取数据的实时性。Cloudflare 为免费用户提供了每天 500w 行读取和 10w 行写入的免费额度，只要好好加以利用，就不太可能超出限额。后续我还考虑通过这些数据库的数据使用 Cloudflare Worker 构建 uptime status 的后端

Often Debian archives are in the debian/ directory on the server but can be anywhere else (many mirrors for example have it in a pub/linux/debian directory, for example).The distribution part (stable in this case) specifies a subdirectory in $ARCHIVE_ROOT/dists. It can contain additional slashes to specify subdirectories nested deeper, eg. stable/updates. distribution typically corresponds to Suite or Codename specified in the Release files. FIXME is this enforced anyhow?To download packages from a repository apt would download an InRelease or Release file from the $ARCHIVE_ROOT/dists/$DISTRIBUTION directory. 我尝试了访问 ，获得了一系列索引文件的索引。 第一段中就能看到熟悉的  文件。根据我 deepin-elf-verify 相关博客中记载，这个文件中会保存 deb 文件的相对路径。我们先拼出 amd64 架构的 Packages 文件下载链接: https://pro-store-packages.uniontech.com/appstore/dists/eagle-pro/appstore/binary-amd64/Packages 这里可以看到源中每一个 deb 包的信息。图中红色方框框出的便是其中一个 deb 包在源中的相对路径。 我们可以使用 grep 命令去检索 weixin 或者 wechat 关键词 在这个路径前加上之前  文件中给出的 url 前缀，即可拼凑出 deb 包的完整下载地址: https://pro-store-packages.uniontech.com/appstore/pool/appstore/c/com.tencent.wechat/com.tencent.wechat_1.0.0.236_amd64.deb 放到浏览器中尝试，果然可以正常下载 html pre.shiki code .sAdtL, html code.shiki .sAdtL{--shiki-default:#4078F2;--shiki-dark:#61AFEF}html pre.shiki code .sAGMh, html code.shiki .sAGMh{--shiki-default:#986801;--shiki-dark:#D19A66}html pre.shiki code .sDhpE, html code.shiki .sDhpE{--shiki-default:#50A14F;--shiki-dark:#98C379}html pre.shiki code .s5ixo, html code.shiki .s5ixo{--shiki-default:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF}html .default .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}html.dark .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-dark);background: var(--shiki-dark-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-dark-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-dark-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration);}","level":1},{"id":"/2021/11/26/typora-and-me","title":"Typora与我","titles":[],"content":"Typora 要收费了，$14.9 买断制，支持三设备激活。而且尚且不知道这里买断的是单个大版本更新还是多个大版本更新。 很多人说，不要紧，我们有VsCode、我们有Vnote、我们有MarkText。。。 但我还是不习惯。 Typora真的就是个非常纯粹的Markdown编辑器，他有所见即所得的视觉效果，同时为我提供了沉浸式的写作体验。 当我在使用Typora写文章的时候，我就是个非常单纯的内容创作者，我不需要去考虑各种Markdown的语法格式，我只需要用文字写下我所想的，然后通过右键菜单把文字的样式调整到一个能够合理突出主次的程度，便完成了。若是用的时间长了，记住了打开菜单时旁边现实的快捷键，那速度便更快了。即使有插入图片/视频的需求，我也只需要将图片复制进 Typora 的编辑框，我在Typora预先设置好的自定义上传命令会自动调用我部署在本地的PicUploader完成上传，并将媒体文件以 Markdown/html 语法呈现在编辑框中。 这样一来，我的行文思路就是连贯、不受打断的。即使需要从系统中截取一些图片作说明用途，我也可以通过 Flameshot 截取图片并简单画几个箭头、标几个序号或者框几个按钮后复制到剪切板，并最终粘贴到Typora的编辑框中，整个过程就像是我在和别人QQ聊天时截个图发过去一般简单。 倘若我使用别的Markdown编辑器，我便需要将图片保存到本地、手动上传到图床、手动写markdown的语法，如此一来，我的精力就被分散了，那我也就不会有为文章插入图片的兴趣，抑或是插入完某张图片以后深感心力憔悴，便把写了一半的文章束之高阁，欺骗自己将来有一天我会继续完成这篇文章。 总而言之，Typora对于我而言确实是非常有用的工具，而我将在接下来的半年到一年时间中过渡到其他的开源Markdown编辑器中。即使改变我的使用习惯将是一件非常痛苦的事情，但我不得不这么做。Typora内置的electron在Archlinux的滚动更新下不知道过多久会出现与系统不兼容的情况1，所以这意味着继续使用老版本的Typora并不是长久之策，我需要在此之前尽快切换到其他的Markdown编辑器。而我不是个商业公司的Markdown工程师，单纯为了个人兴趣而花大价钱去买这一款生产力工具却无法得到经济回馈似乎并不是一个明智的选择。 反转了，仔细阅读Typora官网的Q&A后发现了这么一条: Can I use Typora for free ?You will have a 15 days free trial before the purchase. If you use  dev version or Linux version, you will have unlimited trial time if you  keep Typora updated. But we may show “trial button” or disable certain  features to encourage you to purchase our app, but basic and most  functions will be kept. 看起来 Dev 版和 Linux版本在最新版本可以无限试用下去，那我不考虑改变我的写作习惯了。 注: Dev 版藏得有点深，在这里 Footnotesbaidunetdisk-bin内置的electron已经无法在如今的Archlinux上跑起来了，目前唯一的解决方案是拆包、并使用系统级的electron去启动百度网盘，也就是AUR的baidunetdisk-electron。但是typora运用了一些混淆/加密的手段，使得只有他内置的electron才可以正确启动程序。

CloudflareMirrors非常适合境外的vps使用，免去了用户自行给一个个镜像站测速的麻烦。","level":1},{"id":"/2024/10/12/use-gpt-to-review-waline-comments","title":"使用 GPT 对 waline 的评论进行审查","titles":[],"content":"前一阵子收到了这么一条来自 waline

walinejs/plugin 提供了一个 tencent-cms 的插件，功能是使用腾讯云的内容审查接口审查评论内容，这和我们需要的功能很像，主体部分和调用方法可以直接借鉴。 可以看到，我们需要在这个被 module.exports 导出的函数中，return 一个对象，如果使用 hooks 编写的话可以调用一些生命周期 hook: 在 preSave 阶段，我们可以通过标注

如果就要做一个渲染器，你这个思路不是最佳实践。每次更新时，你都生成全量的虚拟 HTML，然后再对 HTML 做减法来优化性能。然而，每次更新的增量部分是明确的，为什么不直接用这部分增量去做加法？增量部分通过 markdown-it 的库无法直接获取，但更好的做法是在这一步进行改造：先解析 Markdown 的结构，再利用 Vue 的动态渲染能力生成 DOM。这样，DOM 的复用就可以借助 Vue

这学期期末复习的时候，学校里负责上 JavaScript 的老师给我们提出了一个问题。下面这段代码中， 在 ES Module 下执行会抛出 TypeError 的异常，在 CommonJS 下运行则会输出 undefined，而 B 这个类的 u2 函数则能够在对象实例化以后正常运行。 这个问题涉及到 JavaScript 中箭头函数的作用域以及 this 指向。 **在 JS 中使用 function 关键字定义的普通函数中，this 指针遵循一个规则：谁调用指向谁。**即  这种调用情况下，func 方法内部的this指向obj；如果没有调用者，则严格模式下 this 为 undefined，非严格模式下 this 指向window(浏览器)或者global(node环境)。 而箭头函数比较特殊，箭头函数的 this 在定义时就被绑定，绑定的是定义时所在作用域中的 this。 在老师给的示例代码中，第一行定义了 a 这个对象字面量，而定义对象字面量不会创建新的作用域，因此 a 中定义的 u2 的 this 指向的是全局对象。因此在 Es Module 默认启用 strict mode 的情况下，全局对象的 this 指向 undefined，进而导致 a 的 u2 内 this 也指向 undefined，this.x 就抛了 TypeError；而在 CommonJS 未启用 strict mode 的情况下，全局对象的 this 指向全局对象，因而 u2 内的 this 也指向全局对象，因此 this 存在，this.x 就不会抛 TypeError，只会报 undefined。 而 B 类在对象初始化阶段拥有一个新的作用域，因此箭头函数的 this 能够正确指向 B 被实例化出来的对象，因此也就能够正确读取到 this.x 的值。 理论上来说，我们可以给全局对象也赋一个不一样的 x 值，这样 a.u2() 就能够读取到全局对象中的 x 值，验证我们的结论。 在浏览器中，可以在代码的头部加一行  或者 ，可以看到a.u2() 顺利的输出了 10，验证了我的结论。 但在 Node.js 中，直接使用  或者  并不能达到我们想要的效果。因为Node.js 中的每个 CommonJS 模块都有其自己的模块作用域，即模块的顶层作用域不是全局作用域。在模块内部， 关键字不是指向  对象，而是指向模块的导出对象。这是为了确保模块内部的作用域隔离和模块的封装性。 那么我们可以通过为模块的导出对象添加一个 x 属性来验证我们的结论，我们可以使用  来为模块的顶层作用域添加一个值为 10 的 x 属性。","level":1},{"id":"/2024/01/14/where-does-this-refer-in-arrow-function-in-js#参考文章","title":"参考文章","titles":["在 JavaScript 中，箭头函数中的 this 指针到底指向哪里？"],"content":"箭头函数表达式 - JavaScript | MDN

9月6日更新：AUR的维护者sukanka已经将咱的运行指令直接打进了包内，故本文已经基本失去原本的应用意义，但仍可以作为一个案例来解决类似问题。 在使用腾讯最近推出的Linux原生腾讯会议的时候，咱遇到了个十分影响体验的问题。我在使用KDE的暗色主题，腾讯回忆自作主张将字体颜色调成了白色。然而，字体背景是白色的没，因此导致对比度下降，字体难以辨认。效果大概是这个鬼样子: 然而我一时半会儿却找不到合适的变量在运行腾讯会议之前unset，无法指定它使用一个正确的字体颜色。 此时，我想到了fakehome的解决方案——bwrap。 关于bwrap，依云在ta的博客里讲过运行原理，我在这里直接摘一小段过来 bwrap 的原理是，把 / 放到一个 tmpfs 上，然后需要允许访问的目录通过 bind mount 弄进来。所以没弄进来的部分就是不存在，写数据的话就存在内存里，用完就扔掉了。 而我们要做的，就是开一个tmpfs作为，让腾讯会议读取不到KDE的主题配置文件。 使用如下命令 软件启动确认没有问题后，我们可以更改腾讯会议desktop中的启动命令 将后面的命令改成我们刚刚启动所使用的命令即可。 关键词: bwrap, linux, 暗色模式, 深色模式, 夜间模式, 白色字体, 亮色字体 html
